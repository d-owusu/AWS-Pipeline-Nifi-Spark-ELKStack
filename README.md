# AWS-Pipeline-Nifi-Spark-ELKStack

In this project, I create a Data Pipeline with various AWS services and Apache products such as Apache NiFi, Apache Spark, AWS S3, Amazon EMR cluster, Amazon OpenSearch, Logstash and Kibana etc. i will fetch data from an api with Nifi, transform it  and load  to an S3 bucket.I will then ingest data from an AWS S3 bucket into Amazon OpenSearch. From Amazon OpenSearch i will pass data into Kibana to perform Data visualization on data and also perform data analysis using PySpark
